# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Jayden Johnson**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prong-heartbreaking-bolt)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Yes] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Yes] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Yes] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Yes] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Yes] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Yes] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [Yes] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [Yes] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [No] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [Yes] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [No] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [No] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [No] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [No] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
    -Shortened playback between clues and how long each clue lasts

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  My biggest challenge when creating this submission was deciding on how I wanted to improve upon the base game expected of our submission.
  The one decision I acted upon immediately was to increase the difficulty of the game. I wanted the game to be a bit more challenging the 
  rather bare bones model given to me. My first instinct was to randomize the pattern the buttons would follow. I did this because I figured
  any good memory game wouldn't use the same pattern on every one of its iterations because, by that point, a player would simply memorize the 
  one pattern and be able to solve the puzzle with next to no effort, which would segue into boredom of the game. My next idea was to add in
  additional buttons to increase the number of variables a player would have to keep track of in order to progress through the game. The final tweak I 
  made was to the pacing of the game. I felt the game offered a litle too much time for a player to register each individual clue as they played back to back
  so I cut the time in half to keep the players vigilant. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  After completing my submissions, I'm most curious about what other ways do programming languages overlap and work together in order
  to create fully functional webpages like the one I worked on here. I have little first hand experience in seeing code of different languages
  coexist and function in tandem with one another to produce working software. I also am curious about how other forms of media can be incorporated into
  web development and how they can be presented. I've seen website with consistent background music, videos playing in the background, or animated text throughout
  the page and I would love to see how that is created and used in practice.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would like to add an infinite pattern. I would have it so it keeps adding on to the existing pattern endlessly and it would track 
  how far an individual gets into the pattern. I would then incorporate a sort of leaderboard screen/pop up that will track whoever got the furthest in the infinite pattern and so to give players
  a goal to strive for. I would also want to figure out a way to make the game feel more alive in someway perhaps by animating the buttons or adding a more varied amount of sounds and colors into the game.
